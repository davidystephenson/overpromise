description: Validate data with Zod
globs: **/*
---
- Whenever possible base needed TypeScript types on Zod schemas using `z.infer`
- Do not infer unnecessary types, they are dead code
- Always `.parse` data when it is delivered over a network or read from a file system because the type cannot be inferred.
- Never `.parse` data if its type can be safely inferred.
- Always validate with `.parse`, not `.safeParse`, catching errors only if appropriate
- Do not create inferred types from ZodSchemas unless the type is currently needed somewhere
- Keep schema names in camelCase
- Denote schema variables by ending their name with `Schema`
- Do not use `.strict` with Zod schemas
- Do not manually annotate schemas with `ZodType` or anything else
- Coerce date strings into date objects when appropriate using `z.coerce.date`
