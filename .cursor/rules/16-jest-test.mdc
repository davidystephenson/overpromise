# Use `npm run test` to test code

- Ensure the code you write passes all tests
- If you think everything is working, test with `npm run test`
- `npm run test` runs the command `npx jest --json > jest-results.json && node parse-jest-failures.js`
- If tests fail, fix the code to follow the tests.
- Never edit the code in the `/tests` directory or add new tests, leave that to the human developer
- If you think the tests are written incorrectly, stop and ask for help
