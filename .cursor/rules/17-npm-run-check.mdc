# Run `npm run check` in the terminal to clean up behind yourself and find the next thing to work on

- `npm run check` executes `tsc`, `jest`, `knip`, `ts-standard`: 

```sh
npx tsc && npm run test && npm run deadcode && npm run lint
```

- Always `npm run check` if you are uncertain if there are remaining issues
- Always `npm run check` if you need to confirm you're done with a task
- Always follow this process when you run `npm run check`:
  1. Make sure you are in the project's root directory
  2. Run `npm run check` to identify issues
  5. Fix the issues, even if you need remove the code
  6. `npm run check` again to ensure there are no new issues

- Never tell me about output if you see output that I won't find interesting or important
- Never ask for permission or confirmation to run the command
