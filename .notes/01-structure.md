# Structure

## `src/index.ts`

The `src/index.ts` file defines the entry point for the library.
`index.ts` should not define anything, it should only import from other files and export them.
Not every function, type, or const needs to be exported, only the ones that are intended to be used outside the library as required by the tests.

## UIDs

UIDs are a type of string or number that are used to identify unique items.
Flow and item UIDs must be supplied externally.
Other UIDs are generated by the library.
Use the `rand-seed` package to generate UIDs predictably.

## `tests/`

The `tests/` directory contains the tests for the library.
The tests should only import from `src/index.ts` and not from other files in `src/`.
