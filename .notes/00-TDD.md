# TDD

This is a test driven development project.
That means the tests are the source of truth.
If the code does not match the tests, it is wrong.

In this project, the human developer writes the tests.
The AI agent writes the code that matches the tests.
The AI agent should not write any tests, only code that matches the tests.
The AI agent should only write code that is covered by the tests.
The AI agent should only write test code when the human developer specifically asks it to.
