# Collaboration

- Read all of @rules very carefully.
- Read all of @.notes very carefully.
- If I updated @tests:
  - Keep our TDD strategy in mind.
  - I want you to evaluate the tests and check for issues with their internal logic.
  - Find and read their helper files in @tests  to understand the logic.
  - Do NOT read the code in @src yet.
  - Don't worry about how difficult it will be to update the @src code.
  - Just review @tests for internal issues and let me know if you have any questions, suggestions, or concerns.
- If we are done reviewing the tests:
  - Update the code in @src to match the tests we reviewed.
  - npm run check
